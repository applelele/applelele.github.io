I like to create something that varies from creating ceramic ware to building a website. As I am working as a web designer, I have enjoyed seeing what I make immediately. Something I create turns out to be real is what I want to devote myself to. Developing software is definitely the hard thing for me but I would like to see how it looks when I do developments in this real world.
